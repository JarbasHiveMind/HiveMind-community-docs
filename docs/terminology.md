## Terminology

Before we delve into the depths of the Hivemind Protocol, let's familiarize ourselves with some key terms used within the ecosystem:

- **Node**: A device or software client connected to the Hivemind network.
- **Mind**: A node that actively listens for connections and provides the functionality of ovos-core.
- **Fakecroft**: A mind that imitates ovos-core without actually running it, potentially located within another mind in the chain or not using ovos-core at all.
- **Slave**: A mind that connects to another mind and accepts commands from it.
- **Terminal**: A user-facing node that connects to a mind but doesn't accept connections itself.
- **Bridge**: A node that links an external service to a mind.
- **Hive**: A collection of interconnected nodes forming a collaborative network.
- **Master Mind**: The highest-level node in a hive that is not connected to any other nodes but receives connections from them.
