Welcome to the HiveMind Community Docs!

HiveMind is a community-developed superset or extension of [OpenVoiceOS](https://openvoiceos.github.io/community-docs) the open-source voice operating system.

With HiveMind, you can extend one (or more, but usually just one!) instance of OpenVoiceOS to as many devices as you want, including devices that can't ordinarily run OpenVoiceOS!

HiveMind's developers have successfully connected to OpenVoiceOS from a PinePhone, a 2009 MacBook, and a Raspberry Pi 0, among other devices. 
OpenVoiceOS itself usually runs on our desktop computers or our home servers, but you can use any Mycroft-branded device, or [OpenVoiceOS](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/), as your central unit.
